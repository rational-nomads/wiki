# Getting Started

## 1. Welcome

First off, welcome to the team! We're stoked to have you on board ðŸŽ‰

## 2. Getting Tasks

If you don't have access to the trello, please message or email one of the admins (@todo add contacts link)

Cards are added to a task pool in Trello. Cards represent one discrete chunk of work that needs done. Each card should have:
* An outline of the chunk of work the card represents
* A checklist of items that need completed
* A budget (in New Zealand dollars)

### Task flow

1. Find a card in proposals
2. Assign yourself to the card
3. Move card from `Proposals` to `In Progress`
4. Make a branch for the card card, `[type]/[user]/[task title based on trello card] i.e. `feature/colbr/user-table`
5. Create a Pull Request with no requested reviewers - we have Fleek auto-building PRs which makes it easier to review UI changes
6. When finished, merge `develop` branch into your feature branch
7. Request review from @stacy-hunt and @colbr
8. Move card from `In Progress` to `Stakeholder Review`
10. If changes need to be made, move the card back to `In Progress`
11. When PR is approved and work is merged, move card from `Stakeholder Review` to `Done`
12. At the end of each week, collect the cards you've completed for the week and invoice for them in the #invoices channel in Slack

## 4. Task Budgets

*As of 21/07/2021 task budgets are given when someone assigns themself a card, but we're going to switch it so task budgets are decided by admins and can be negotiated by users*

If you are assigning a task budget yourself, please run it past @colbr/Brett Collins (NZ Standard Time GMT+12) or @stacy-hunt/Stacy Hunt (Peru Standard Time GMT-5) before getting into the task.

## 5. Feedback

We're still ironing out how we want to collaborate as Rational Nomads. Your feedback is very valuable, please let us know what your experience is like working as part of the team - we won't be offended if there's things you would change.
